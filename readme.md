My UHER Royal De Luxe has faulty electronics. 
Upon opening it up, I found that there are several things wrong with it: 

- The sliding "Entzerrerumschalter" often lose their registration and thus don't make proper connections when switching speeds.
    - My machine only works on the 9.5cm/s setting. For all the other speed settings, I have to rotate the speed select to somwehere inbetween the actual numbers.

- Basically all of the resistors are way out of spec (+- 40% and more)
- The capacitors are holding on for dear life

I trying to reverse-engineer the electronics and create new PCBs, since the electronics are mainly simple resistor + capacitor networks and the PCBs are almost all single layer, except for the main pcb, which is a dual layer. Also, the service manual has a complete wiring diagram, so this task doesn't feel completely impossible.

I also want to improve on a few things: 
- All wires are soldered, I want to replace them with JST Connectors so replacing pcbs and parts becomes a lot easier.
- The sliding switches on my machine often don't connect properly and lose their registration. I am currently looking for a solution here. Some options I have considered: 
    - Adding an encoder to the speed dial and switching the networks digitally with mosfets or transistors.
    - Adding a sliding pot to the mechanical linkages which used to activate the "Entzerrerumschalter"
    
If someone has other / better ideas for the "Entzerrerumschalter", please let me know and I will consider those. I know that the electromechanical nature of the machine is a big appeal, but those parts are simply prone to malfunctioning (at least on my machine) that I want to improve those.
